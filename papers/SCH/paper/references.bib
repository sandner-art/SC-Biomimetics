  abstract = {Personalized ventilation (PV) is a mean of delivering conditioned outdoor air into the breathing zone of the occupants. This study aims to qualitatively investigate the personalized flows using two methods of visualization: (1) schlieren imaging using a large schlieren mirror and (2) thermography using an infrared camera. While the schlieren imaging was used to render the velocity and mass transport of the supplied flow, thermography was implemented to visualize the air temperature distribution induced by the PV. Both studies were conducted using a thermal manikin to simulate an occupant facing a PV outlet. As a reference, the flow supplied by an axial fan and a cased axial fan was visualized with the schlieren system as well and compared to the flow supplied by PV. Schlieren visualization results indicate that the steady, low-turbulence flow supplied by PV was able to penetrate the thermal convective boundary layer encasing the manikin's body, providing clean air for inhalation. Contrarily, the axial fan diffused the supplied air over a large target area with high turbulence intensity; it only disturbed the convective boundary layer rather than destroying it. The cased fan supplied a flow with a reduced target area which allowed supplying more air into the breathing zone compared to the fan. The results of thermography visualization showed that the supplied cool air from PV penetrated the corona-shaped thermal boundary layer. Furthermore, the supplied air cooled the surface temperature of the face, which indicates the large impact of PV on local thermal sensation and comfort.}
